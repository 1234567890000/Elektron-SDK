Summary:
--------

The Libxml2 Library is a C-language XML parser library developed for the

Compiling Source:
-----------------

The included makefile is set up to run from the file
locations as presented through the distribution package.
It is set up for building on the supported Solaris or Linux 
platforms using the supported compilers.  This includes 
SunStudio12 for Solaris 10, gcc4.1.2 for Red Hat AS5, 
gcc4.4.4 for Red Hat AS6, and gcc4.8.2 for Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit only).

The COMPILE_BITS value in the makefile is used to control
whether 32 or 64 bit version of the libraries are built.  
If a 64 bit library build is desired, COMPILE_BITS should
be set to 64 (which is the default setting).  If 32 bit 
library build is desired, COMPILE_BITS should be set
to 32.  

To compile, run the gmake command.

After building, ensure that all custom libraries and headers are moved to
appropriate locations for linking with applications.

Gmake can be obtained at http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
