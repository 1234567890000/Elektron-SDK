      <div class="Body"><a name="1221599">The </a><span class="Concept">Transport API Reactor</span> is a connection management and event processing component that can significantly reduce the amount of code an application must write to leverage OMM. This component helps simplify many aspects of a typical Transport API application, regardless of whether the application is an OMM Consumer, OMM Interactive Provider, or OMM Non-Interactive Provider. The Transport API Reactor can help manage Consumer and Non-Interactive Provider start-up processing, including user log in, source directory establishment, and dictionary download. It also allows for dispatching of events to user implemented callback functions, handles flushing of user written content, and manages network pings on the user’s behalf. Value Added domain representations are coupled with the Reactor, allowing domain specific callbacks to be presented with their respective domain representation for easier, more logical access to content. For a list and comparison of Transport API and Transport API Reactor functionalities, refer to <a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('Value_Add_Developers_Guide', 'Chap_Reactor_Detailed_View.6.003.html', '');" title="6.1.1 Functionality: Transport API Versus Transport API Reactor">Section 6.1.1</a>.</div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1222292">The Transport API Reactor internally depends on the Administration Domain Model Representation component. This allows the user to provide and consume the administrative RDM types in a more logical format. This additionally hides encoding and decoding of these domains from the Reactor user, all interaction is via a simple structural representation. More information about the Administration Domain Model Representation value added component is available in </a><a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('Value_Add_Developers_Guide', 'Chap_AdminDomain_Models_Detailed_View.7.001.html', '');" title="Chapter 7 Administration Domain Models Detailed View">Chapter 7</a>. The Transport API Reactor also leverages several utility components, contained in the Value Added Utilities. This includes constructs like mutex locks, a simple queue, and memory buffers. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1222293">The Transport API Reactor helps to manage the life-cycle of a connection on the user’s behalf. When a channel is associated with a Reactor, the Reactor will perform all necessary transport level initialization and alert the user, via a callback, when the connection is up, ready for use, and down. An application can simultaneously run multiple unique reactor instances, where each Reactor instance can associate and manage a single channel or multiple channels. This functionality allows users to quickly and easily horizontally scale their application to leverage multi-core systems or distribute content across multiple connections.</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1222294">Each instance of the Transport API Reactor leverages multiple threads to help manage inbound and outbound data efficiently. The following figure illustrates a high-level view of the Reactor threading model.</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt"><a name="1222310"><img class="Default" src="images/Chap_Reactor_Detailed_View.6.002.1.jpg" width="260" height="215" style="display: inline; float: none; left: 0.0; top: 0.0" alt="" /></a></span></div>
      <div class="FigTitle">Figure 4.  <a name="1222312">Transport API Reactor Thread Model</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1222378">There are two main threads associated with each Transport API Reactor instance. The application thread is the main driver of the Reactor; all event dispatching (e.g., reading), callback processing, and submitting of data to the Transport API is done from this thread. This is done to reduce latency and simplify any threading model associated with the user defined callback functions – because callbacks happen from the application thread, a single threaded application does not need to have additional mutex locking. The Transport API Reactor also leverages an internal worker thread. The worker thread flushes any queued outbound data and manages outbound network pings for all channels associated with the Reactor.</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1222379">The application drives the Reactor with the use of a dispatch function. The dispatch function reads content from the network, performs some light processing to handle inbound network pings, and provides the information to the user through a series of per-channel, user defined callback functions. Callback functions are separated based on whether they are Reactor callbacks or channel callbacks. Channel callbacks are separated by domain, with a default callback where all unhandled domains or non-OMM content are provided to the user. The application can choose whether to dispatch on a single channel or across all channels being managed by the Reactor. The application can leverage an I/O notification mechanism (e.g. select, poll) or periodically call dispatch – it is all up to the user.</a></div>
