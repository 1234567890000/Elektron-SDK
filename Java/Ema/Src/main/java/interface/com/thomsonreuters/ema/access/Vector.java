/**
 * Vector is a homogeneous container of complex data type entries.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Vector is a collection which provides iterator over the elements in this
 * collection.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <br>
 * Vector entries are identified by index.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Vector supports two methods of adding containers; they are: <br>
 * - adding of already populated containers, (e.g. {@link #complete()} was
 * called on these containers) and <br>
 * - adding of clear containers (e.g. {@link #clear()} was called on these
 * containers) which would be populated after that.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The first method of adding of already populated containers allows for easy
 * data manipulation but incurs additional memory copy. This method is useful in
 * applications extracting data containers from some messages or containers and
 * then setting them on other containers.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The second method allows for fast container population since it avoids
 * additional memory copy incurred by the first method. This method is useful in
 * source applications setting OMM data from native data formats.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * These two methods apply to containers only; e.g. ElementList, FieldList,
 * FilterList, Map, Series, and Vector.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class are intended to be short lived or rather transitional.
 * <br>
 * This class is designed to efficiently perform setting and extracting of
 * Vector and its content. <br>
 * Objects of this class are not cache-able.
 * </p>
