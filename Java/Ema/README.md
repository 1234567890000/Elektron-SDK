## EMA Dependencies
Building of EMA library and Running of EMA examples both depend on apache jars listed as below:

- apache\org.apache.commons.collections.jar
- apache\commons-configuration-1.10\commons-configuration-1.10.jar
- apache\commons-lang-2.6\commons-lang-2.6.jar
- apache\commons-logging-1.2\commons-logging-1.2.jar

Here is one download site for apache jar files http://commons.apache.org/downloads/

## Turn on log tracing ( one way to turn on log, SLF4J interface with java.util.logging implementation )
Add java run option to point to the path of java.util.logging configuration file.

For example:

	set LOGGINGCONFIGPATH=..\main\resource\logging.properties

	java -cp %CLASSPATH% -Djava.util.logging.config.file=%LOGGINGCONFIGPATH% com.thomsonreuters.ema.examples.training.series100.example100__MarketPrice__Streaming.Consumer
